# Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (defense-advanced-research-projects-agency)
Since 1958, DARPA has held to an enduring mission: To create technological surprise for U.S. national security. Working with innovators inside and outside government, we have delivered on that mission many times over  transforming the seemingly impossible into world-changing defense and national security capabilities. Often, DARPA innovations also become fixtures of modern civilian life. Created in response to the launch of Sputnik in 1957, DARPA stands as our nations commitment to never again face a strategic technical surprise.
