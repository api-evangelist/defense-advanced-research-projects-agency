  Since 1958, DARPA has held to an enduring mission: To create technological
  surprise for U.S. national security. Working with innovators inside and
  outside government, we have delivered on that mission many times over 
  transforming the seemingly impossible into world-changing defense and national
  security capabilities. Often, DARPA innovations also become fixtures of modern
  civilian life. Created in response to the launch of Sputnik in 1957, DARPA
  stands as our nations commitment to never again face a strategic technical
  surprise.
